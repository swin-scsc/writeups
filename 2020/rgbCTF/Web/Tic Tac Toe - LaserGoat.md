## Solution:

This was quite a simple challenge. Upon opening the URL provided, we found a 3x3 grid in which you can play Tic Tac Toe against a CPU player.

When you lose, no flag is given (obviously).

If the game ends in a draw, you are rewarded with a flag! Too bad itâ€™s invalid.

Upon winning against the CPU, we are finally rewarded the flag.
