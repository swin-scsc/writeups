## Process

This one was fairly simple, but had a twist thrown in. There was also a file given, but it was about as useless as a turning indicator in a BMW.

We were given a string of hex digits (see the description), that when converted from hex to ascii, spat out the following: `qfaBSEz@QL^0y^1^dY^8a6e7c|`. At first glance, this looked like gibberish, but the first 6 characters gave it away â€“ three lowercase, three uppercase, which was the flag format (rgbCTF). This then required rot-47 (as oppose to rot-13) with a rotation amount of 1, which then gave me the flag.
### Flag: rgbCTF{ARM_1z_2_eZ_9b7f8d}
