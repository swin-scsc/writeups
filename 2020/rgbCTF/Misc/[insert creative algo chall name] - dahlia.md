## Solution

Rather than being given a file or information in the challenge description, for this challenge we were linked to a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/pKNVLkTs) which contained the challenge details as follows: 

```
Find the total number of unique combinations for input values of x = 4 and n = 12
There exists a set of values, r, with values binary increasing (2^0, 2^1, ... 2^(n-1))
A combination is a set of x values where each value is generated by creating x subsets of r with all values within a subset being summed
The x subsets should use all values in r exactly once.

Example Case:
Input:
x = 3
n = 5

Given the input above we can create a set r that consists of the following n values
[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4]
OR
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]

Each combination is formed via x subsets of the set [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
[16], [2,8], [1, 4]
[1, 2, 4], [8], [16]
[1, 4], [2, 8], [16]
...

This renders sets of size x that are the sums of the elements of each set
16, 10, 5
7, 8, 16
5, 10, 16
...

Note: combination 1 and combination 3 are the duplicates and should not be counted twice as they both consist of 5, 10, and 16

All possible unique combinations for x = 3 and n = 5:
3    8    20
4    8    19
1    12    18
4    9    18
5    8    18
2    12    17
4    10    17
6    8    17
1    14    16
2    13    16
3    12    16
4    11    16
5    10    16
6    9    16
7    8    16
1    2    28
1    4    26
2    4    25
1    6    24
2    5    24
3    4    24
1    8    22
2    8    21
1    10    20
2    9    20

Final Output:
25
(There are 25 combinations generated above)

*IMPORTANT*
The answer should be formatted as rgbctf{[output value here]} with your output value replacing [output value here]
```

Basically we were given two values `x = 4,  n = 12`.

We were required to write a program that could take some set `s = 2^0, 2^1, ... 2^(n-1)`, and find all combinations of `x` subsets of `s`, with all the values of each subset summed.

I based the algorithm I wrote from an answer supplied on stack exchange here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30130053/how-find-all-groups-of-subsets-of-set-a-set-partitions-in-python, which I built on to account for the limit on the number of subsets (x), and for the summing of subsets limiting combinations.

```
kali@kali:~/rgbctf2020/[insert creative algo chall name]$ python3 solve.py
Value of x?: 4
Value of n?: 12
List: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048]
There are 611501 unique combinations for x = 4 and n = 12
Would you like to print all unique combinations? (y/n): n
```

The flag can be found in the count of unique combinations: `611501`.

### Flag: rgbctf{611501}
