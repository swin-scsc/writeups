## Process

Tools:
https://onlinetonegenerator.com/dtmf.html
https://tino1b2be.github.io/DTMF-Decoder/    

Solve:

The tones are DTMF tones. I started manually decoding the tones using reference tones. This was taking a bit long, so I found a DTMF decoder online and sent the file to it.

The output:

7774222228333#99933338#386333#866666337777#

Then I broke this up into the groupings that match the waveform output to get the breakup of numbers.

777 4 22 222 8 333 # 999 33 33 8 # 3 8 6 333 # 8 666 66 33 7777 #

The numbers correspond to a phone keypad.
