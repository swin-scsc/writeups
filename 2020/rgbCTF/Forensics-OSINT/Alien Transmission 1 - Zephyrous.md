## Process

This one was a very simple SSTV signal. The only messing around with it that I had to do was to resample the .wav file we were given from 44.1KHz to 11.025KHz, because thatâ€™s the sample rate that my SSTV decoder likes to be fed (I use MMSSTTV). 

Formatted correctly, MMSSTV decodes it to the following:
